This WordPress plugin extends the Gravity Forms plugin with the Spanish translation.

== Description ==
> This plugin requires the <a href="http://www.closemarketing.es/likes/gravityforms/">Gravity Forms plugin</a>. <strong>Don't use Gravity Forms? <a href="http://www.closemarketing.es/likes/gravityforms/">Buy the plugin</a></strong> and start using this revolutionary plugin!

The [Gravity Forms](http://www.closemarketing.es/likes/gravityforms/) developers don't focus on translating
their plugin. Instead they concentrate on the core functionalities of the plugin itself.
Therefore there are regular updates of the Gravity Forms plugin. However, after each
automatic update, the manually placed Spanish translations are deleted. This plugin fixes
that issue for all the Spanish WordPress and Gravity Forms users!
